I am a researcher with a background in AI & EE, with a particular interest in multi-modal learning. My current work focuses on exploring unified feature representations across modalities and scales, as well as frequency-aware approaches for robust visual perception.

I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. position and engage in Research Assistant roles where I can contribute to projects in computer vision, machine learning, and related AI fields. I am highly motivated to collaborate with leading researchers and further advance my expertise in representation learning.
