excerpt: "Research on multisensor perception models and BEV2Instance optimization."
highlights:
  - For multisensor perception model, propose an infra of model fusion based on shared weights and backbone fusion. Also conducts a cross training strategy for multi-objection and utilize distillation to compensate accuracy. 
  - For bev2instance module in bev perception model, conduct novel optimization the self-attention and deformable attention modules based on precision descent and infra compression and prove efficient in training accuracy
